You've seen the movie starring a crazed Jack Nicholson as Jack, but have you read the novel on which it was based? If not, do, say its many fans. “It's the ultimate ‘book was better than the movie’ conversation starter,” says Ron Block, branch manager of the Middleburg Heights Branch of the Cuyahoga County Public Library in Ohio. He adds, “It's the first book I ever threw across the room from terror.”"

This timeless Gothic tale by the renowned Henry James (author of 1881's The Portrait of a Lady) first appeared as a serial in Collier's magazine in 1898, and is now a classic. “It still makes the hairs on my neck stand up,” Block says. “It hits all the notes, including ghostly apparitions, strangely behaved children, mysterious caretakers and a story that hits you hard.” "

The premise: A group of four researchers stay in an old mansion to determine if there's any truth in rumors of its haunting — and then the tables terrifyingly turn when the house begins to want one of them as its own. It's touted by Rachel Conrad, a bookseller at Wellesley Books in Wellesley, Massachusetts, as “a classic ghost story and one that everyone should read at some point in their life.”"

Lawyer Arthur Kipps visits the home of the late widow Alice Drablow to handle her estate, and experiences the ghost of a woman whose presence signals the imminent death of a child. This dark ghost story, turned into a hit play in London and a 2012 movie starring Daniel Radcliffe, is recommended by Pamela Klinger-Horne of Excelsior Bay Booksellers in Excelsior, Minnesota, who calls it “a traditional Gothic tale that will make you keep all the lights on.”"

We meet writer Ben Mears, who returns to the small Maine town where he grew up to study the history of a particularly disturbing house, now owned by a Kurt Barlow — a strange character who turns out to be an ancient vampire. A young boy becomes a vampire, too, followed by others, and the horror quickly escalates. The novel will “keep you up all night and looking over your shoulder in the day,” says Klinger-Horne. “It almost ended my babysitting career because I was too afraid to be alone in the house.”"

A teenage girl, Marjorie Barrett, appears to be losing her mind and is thought to be possessed by demons, then winds up on a reality show called The Possession, where even more horrifying devilment ensues. Years later, her sister Merry revisits the show to find out what really happened … and why. Conrad at Wellesley Books says, “It took me two tries to get through A Head Full of Ghosts. … It was so unsettling that I couldn't bring myself to finish it the first time around. The second time I tried reading it I could only do so in the morning, in full daylight.”"

She begins to recall a story: The boy's mother had taken her sick son to a healer, who tried to revive him by allowing half his soul to be taken over by a stranger's — a stranger who turns out to be a monster she somehow has to vanquish. “I think Fever Dream is one of the most terrifying books of all time,” says Hannah Robinson, a bookseller at Porter Square Books in Cambridge, Massachusetts. “The slow-burning suspense genuinely made me sweat while reading this creepy little novel.”"

The con artist soon begins to think that the apparitions she's seeing just might be real — especially when the woman's teenage son's behavior turns rather weird. Conrad says, “Flynn also does an expert job of making the reader wonder whether anything supernatural is happening at all or if it's all in the protagonist's head.”"

      "desc": "The men on board HMS Terror have every expectation of triumph. As part of the 1845 Franklin Expedition, the first steam-powered vessels ever to search for the legendary Northwest Passage, they are as scientifically supported an enterprise as has ever set forth. As they enter a second summer in the Arctic Circle without a thaw, though, they are stranded in a nightmarish landscape of encroaching ice and darkness. Endlessly cold, with diminishing rations, 126 men fight to survive with poisonous food, a dwindling supply of coal, and ships buckling in the grip of crushing ice. But their real enemy is far more terrifying. There is something out there in the frigid darkness: an unseen predator stalking their ship, a monstrous terror constantly clawing to get in.When the expedition's leader, Sir John Franklin, meets a terrible death, Captain Francis Crozier takes command and leads his surviving crewmen on a last, desperate attempt to flee south across the ice. With them travels an Inuit woman who cannot speak and who may be the key to survival, or the harbinger of their deaths. But as another winter approaches, as scurvy and starvation grow more terrible, and as the terror on the ice stalks them southward, Crozier and his men begin to fear that there is no escape."
